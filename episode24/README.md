# The [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) Series #3 - Resources

Go in 5 Minutes, episode 24.

We've been looking at the [Buffalo framework](https://gobuffalo.io) lately, and
we're gonna keep on going today with [resources](https://gobuffalo.io/en/docs/resources).

Basically, resources are a bunch of HTTP endpoints organized around a single
database model. Today, we're going to see how to:

- Create a new resource with the `buffalo` CLI
- Write code to do useful things with the resource

Check out the screencast for more!
