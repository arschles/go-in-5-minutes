# Go in 5 Minutes Financial Contributors

Go in 5 Minutes is a screencast series [I](https://github.com/arschles) created because
I believe short, focused screencasts are one of the best ways to help Gophers all over
the world advance their skills.

The concepts I've covered have helped developers get involved in the community, get a new
Go job, or just learn something new. Over 3000 Gophers have benefitted from the content
so far.

Financial contributions help pay for development of new material and production of
new screencasts.

If you or your company has benefitted from the lessons that Go in 5 Minutes teaches,
please consider supporting the screencast to help Gophers all over the world learn
Go and level up their skills.
