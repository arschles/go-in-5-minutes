# Using [`github.com/stretchr/testify/suite`](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite) To Write More Robust Tests

Go in 5 Minutes, episode 20.

This screencast teaches how to use the 
[`github.com/stretchr/testify/suite`](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/suite) package
to test Go apps.

This package lets us more easily write our tests than using the bare standard library's
[`testing`](https://godoc.org/testing) package. `suite` package doesn't replace the standard
library, but it builds upon it. 

Check out the screencast to learn more!
