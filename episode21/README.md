# Getting Started with [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) to Build Awesome Websites

Go in 5 Minutes, episode 21.

How do you build a web application in Go? For a while, we all just cobbled something

Until now... Enter [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io). This is the most popular framework
today for building _awesome_ full-stack web applications with Go. You don't need to
drop back to Ruby/PHP/Python land to build beautiful website anymore!
