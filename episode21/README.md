# Getting Started with [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) to Build Awesome Websites

Go in 5 Minutes, episode 21.

How do you build a website with Go? For a while, we all just cobbled something
together with the standard library, Gorilla Mux, and so on. We had to figure all this stuff
out for ourselves, and more!

- A database ORM
- Database migrations
- Templating
- Javascript & "frontend stuff"
- An asset pipeline
- Having a good development environment
- Compiling for production?
- Dockerizing the app
- Background jobs

That's a long list! But other languages have good frameworks to handle all of it. I love
Go, but before Buffalo I wouldn't have chosen it to build a full-on website.

In other words, we didn't have a "Rails for Go" before Buffalo.

[Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) is now one of the most popular frameworks today for building 
_awesome_ full-stack web applications with Go, because it's a framework like Rails! You don't need to drop back to Ruby/PHP/Python land to build beautiful website in Go anymore :smile:.
