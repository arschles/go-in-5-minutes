_Episode 7_

We explain what `go get` does, and why is isn't sufficient for dependency management. We also explain what a reproducible build is in Go and why it's so important, and explain why vendoring achieves reproducible builds. We then introduce [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) and show how we'd vendor the [code from episode 6](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/tree/master/episode6) using the tool.
