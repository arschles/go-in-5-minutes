<p>I posted
<a href="/screencast/episode_17_the_error_interface/">the last Go in 5 Minutes screencast</a>
on November 6, 2016, and haven&rsquo;t posted any casts or blog posts since then.</p>

<p><strong>After more than a year, I&rsquo;m excited to say that I&rsquo;m bringing the series back!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to take some time here to explain why I took the time off, why I&rsquo;m bringing the series back, and what my plans are for the future.</p>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>

<p>When I started the series, I wanted to do one screencast a week. Realistically, I probably averaged close to every two weeks. Life happens, amirite?</p>

<p>Initially, each screencast took me about 6 hours to prepare, record, upload, and &ldquo;market&rdquo; (posting to Twitter, the Golang subreddit, etc&hellip;). I eventually got down to 4 hours per screencast. Pretty good!</p>

<p>Over the first few months, quite a few folks started watching the screencasts and GIFM got a good following. I heard from at least 20 folks who depended on GIFM to advance their skills and even achieve their career goals with the content I was creating.</p>

<p>I was helping folks, I loved Go (still do), and more people than I could imagine were watching my content. What an awesome feeling!</p>

<h1 id="why-i-took-time-off">Why I Took Time Off</h1>

<p>But, like folks in other open source projects, I was starting to get burned out&hellip;</p>

<p>Four hours a week doesn&rsquo;t sound like a ton of work, but I had a full time job (and I still do), so realistically it meant at least a half day every weekend that I was spending on GIFM.</p>

<p>I loved what I was doing but I had a lot going on in my life at the time. I was starting a new job and looking for a house (a big feat in the Bay Area). Then I got engaged and my then-fiancee started planning our wedding. I was also doing a lot of speaking at conferences all through 2017.</p>

<p>I had so much going on in my life but I thought I could keep going. In early January 2017, I <em>knew</em> I could find the time to keep going.</p>

<p>What was a half day every weekend?</p>

<p>By early February 2017, I had started on a few screencasts but never finished. Later that month, I admitted to myself that GIFM was gonna be really hard to keep up in 2017. By that point, a half day every weekend was <em>hard</em> to keep up.</p>

<p>I owed it to myself to give my attention to these life-changing things going on in my life.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. I didn&rsquo;t want to take the year off but I had to.</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m back, ready to go again.</p>

<h1 id="why-i-m-bringing-gifm-back">Why I&rsquo;m Bringing GIFM Back</h1>

<p>2017 was a huge year for me, as you can imagine. My now-wife and I got married and bought our first house. Professionally, I started to do a lot more technical talks at big conferences and the <a href="https://deis.com">little company</a> I was working for got acquired by a <a href="https://microsoft.com">big one</a>.</p>

<p>Lots has changed, but I never forgot about GIFM. I always had this idea in the back of my head that I&rsquo;d start it back up again.</p>

<p>I still write Go in my day job, and now I lead a team of engineers who do as well. One engineer on my team even told me recently that he feels like he&rsquo;s become a great Go programmer because I helped him get there.</p>

<p>Sooooo, that was an awesome feeling.</p>

<p>I feel crazy lucky to have helped everyone who I helped with GIFM. I feel like I&rsquo;ve made this community a little bit more special than it was before I came along.</p>

<p>And now I can keep it going. I have the time and energy to start GIFM again, so here we go!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to do some things differently this time, though, and here they are:</p>

<h2 id="the-blog">The Blog</h2>

<p>I started a GIFM blog near around the end of August 2016, but I only posted twice to it. I&rsquo;ve also recently started a <a href="https://medium.com/@arschles">personal blog on Medium.com</a> as well. I want to keep both blogs, so here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m gonna balance them:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to write personal things on my personal blog :) Everything on the blog is about tech so far. Lots of it is about Kubernetes, Cloud Native technologies and Go</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to cross-post relevant content between my personal blog and the GIFM blog. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how it&rsquo;s going to look yet, so expect to see some experimentation here</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to use the GIFM blog to keep folks updated on when to expect the next episode of GIFM. I hope those posts will help people in some way, but they&rsquo;re important to me because they&rsquo;ll keep me accountable :)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to do some talks on Go or related topics in 2017, and I plan to keep speaking! I&rsquo;m going to post videos of my talks on the blog too</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-screencasts">The Screencasts</h2>

<p>Prior to the hiatus, I posted each screencast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2GHqYE3fVJMncbrRd8AqcA">to Youtube</a>. I&rsquo;m still going to do that! I&rsquo;m also going to continue posting them to the GIFM <a href="https://www.goin5minutes.com/screencasts/">screencasts list</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to be experimenting with some more ways to get the word out about both my screencasts and blog posts. If you have ideas, please post them <a href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues/new">here</a>!</p>

<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m proud to have given a lot of talks at conferences in 2017, and I&rsquo;ve gotten good reviews on them. I&rsquo;m going to experiment with posting these talks &ndash; and my talks going forward &ndash; to the screencasts page as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-ads">The Ads</h2>

<p>I love GIFM and the community, but I can&rsquo;t justify starting this thing up unless I can make some money for my time and content.</p>

<p>I get that your first instinct may be to hate/unsubscribe/ragequit/flame-me-on-reddit for putting ads on the site.</p>

<p><em>I only ask that you read what&rsquo;s below before you make your decision.</em></p>

<h4 id="what-i-tried-in-2016">What I Tried in 2016</h4>

<p>In 2016, I tried selling <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/yVKMQ">a</a> <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/zPgyB">few</a> <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/piJiE">products</a> alongside Go in 5 Minutes. They did decently, but I spent a lot of time on them and couldn&rsquo;t justify the time I was spending for the price I was charging.</p>

<p>I also tried getting sponsorships for the screencasts. I succeeded, but the overhead of acquiring and managing clients was too much for me to manage then.</p>

<h4 id="what-i-m-trying-now">What I&rsquo;m Trying Now</h4>

<p>Fast forward to now. The discussion on how to make money from open source projects is starting up (again). <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open collective</a> looks to be getting adoption across some projects. Patreon has too, despite the recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/13/patreon-will-not-change-its-fee-structure/">pricing drama</a>.</p>

<p>Open collective is a tool to organize and budget OSS projects. That doesn&rsquo;t fit the model that GIFM is. Maybe if others get involved one day, I&rsquo;ll start a collective.</p>

<p>Patreon seems like a good choice for GIFM, and I looked into it a bit. I want to try it out, but I am still a little bit uncomfortable with the pricing changes that the company made-and-then-unmade (see link above). I want to research a bit more to see what I&rsquo;m getting myself into, and then try it out.</p>

<p>Until I can prove it works and I can make some money with it, I&rsquo;ve put Google ads on the site. You probably noticed one at the top of this post. I&rsquo;ve put them on at the top of the blog post pages and the bottom of the screencast pages.</p>

<h4 id="what-to-do-if-you-hate-ads">What To Do If You Hate Ads</h4>

<p>Practically speaking, adding Google Ads was the fastest, easiest way &ndash; that I was comfortable with &ndash; to get started with trying to make money on this project. Had Patreon not recently had the bad press recently, I probably would have gone with them.</p>

<p>So if you hate ads on principle and can&rsquo;t be talked out of it, I get it if you want to use AdBlock. I hope that you&rsquo;ll still recommend GIFM to other folks so this thing can still grow (and maybe some of them will click on ads ;)</p>

<p>If you hate <em>me</em> for putting ads on my site, that&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m sorry I disappointed you and I hope you can hate me and also understand me at the same time.</p>

<p>If not, maybe your Reddit trash talk will help spread the word about GIFM :)</p>
