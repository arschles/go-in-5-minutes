_Episode 30_

Another episode in the [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) series! We're going to talk about how to use the [pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop) library alongside Buffalo to quickly and seamlessly integrate a database into your web application.

<!--more-->

I'll briefly introduce the library and how to use it, then we'll go right to the code and see it in action! This screencast is a whirlwind tour of everything database related in Buffalo. We're going to follow up in future screencasts to dive into many of the larger topics we visited in this one.

Keep on rockin', Gophers!
