## Outline

1. `go get`
2. Reproducible builds
3. A Rich History
  - [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) (my favorite) & Others
  - [Go 1.5 Vendor Experiment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo/edit)
  - [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) - not the first or the last implementation
4. Example

## Note

Since dependency code is stored on Github, dependencies are mutable. I have checked in the vendor directory here so that you can compile & test this code. To experiment, just `rm -rf vendor` and run the `glide` commands.
