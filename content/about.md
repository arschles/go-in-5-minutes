      I'm Aaron Schlesinger, creator of Go In 5 Minutes. I've been writing Go code for just over 2 years and
      I've gathered some best practices, tips and tricks, great packages, and other general knowledge on how to
      write good Go code in "the Go way".

    <h2>Concise Lessons</h2>
    <p>
      You're a busy professional. Instead of reading entire books on the language, use
      these screencasts to quickly learn focused, relevant topics.

    <h2>Real, Working Code</h2>
    <p>
      Each screencast explains and runs real, working code. And everything
      is open source <a href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes">on Github</a>.

    <h2>You're Involved</h2>
    <p>
      I use Github to get your feedback. Simply
      <a href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues">create an issue</a> to request
      topics for future screencasts, ask questions or start a discussion.

    <h2>Perfect For All Levels</h2>
    <p>
      I aim the content in these screencasts at intermediate Go developers, but I talk to developers
      of all experience levels that learn from Go In 5 Minutes. If you're unsure, spend 5 minutes
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4BCLimksY">watching the first screencast</a>
      to see if it's right for you.
