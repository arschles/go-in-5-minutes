        <h2>Concise Lessons</h2>
        <p>
          You're a busy professional. Instead of reading entire books on the language, use
          these screencasts to quickly learn focused, relevant topics.

        <h2>Real, Working Code</h2>
        <p>
          Each screencast explains and runs real, working code. And everything
          is open source <a href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes">on Github</a>.

          I use Github to get your feedback. Simply
          <a href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues">create an issue</a> to request
          topics for future screencasts, ask questions or start a discussion.

              I aim the content in these screencasts at intermediate Go developers, but I talk to developers
              of all experience levels that learn from Go In 5 Minutes. If you're unsure, spend 5 minutes
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4BCLimksY">watching the first screencast</a>
              to see if it's right for you.
