## No Screencast The Weekend of 11/28/2015

Starting later this week, I'll be traveling to spend time with my family for [Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving), so there won't be a screencast or a newsletter next weekend.

For everyone who celebrates Thanksgiving, happy Thanksgiving! If you don't, have a great week and weekend. In the spirit of the holiday, I'm thankful for everyone who enjoys the content I produce and motivates me to produce the best screencasts I possibly can.

I'll see everyone in two weeks.
