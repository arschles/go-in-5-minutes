        <h3>Learn Go In Pieces</h3>
        <p>
          There are plenty of books, screencasts and tutorials on the web that present a comprehensive
          guide to learning the <i>entire</i> language at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go In 5 Minutes teaches differently. I believe that developers can learn more efficiently by focusing on smaller practical examples.

        <h3>Weekly Lessons</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, I publish lessons at the beginning of each week and keep them to around 5 minutes
          (hence the title).

        <h3>Request a Topic</h3>
        <p>
          Go In 5 Minutes is relatively new, and the success of the series so far has been because
          of the audience. I rely on you to suggest topics that you'd like me to cover.

        <p>
          Lessons come out at the beginning of each week and cover best practices, practical code examples,
          designs patterns and more. Content is aimed at intermediate Go developers, but developers of all
          skill levels have found value in the content.

        <p>
          And, I am always available for questions on the content. Simply ask questions on the video comments
