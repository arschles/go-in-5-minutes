    <h2>The Author</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Aaron Schlesinger, creator of Go In 5 Minutes. I've been writing Go code for about 4
      years. I've gathered best practices, tips and tricks, great packages, and other practical
      knowledge and best practices on how to write good Go code in <i>the Go way</i>.

    <p>
      You're a busy professional. Instead of reading entire books on the language, use
      these screencasts to quickly learn focused, relevant topics.

    <h2>Real, Working Code</h2>
    <p>
      Each screencast explains and runs real, working code. And everything
      is open source <a href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes">on Github</a>.

    <h2>You're Involved</h2>
    <p>
      I use Github to get your feedback. Simply
      <a href="https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues">create an issue</a> to request
      topics for future screencasts, ask questions or start a discussion.
    </p>

    <h2>Perfect For All Levels</h2>
    <p>
      I teach all things Go in these screencasts, so there's just as much beginner content as advanced. Still not sold?
      Take 5 minutes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4BCLimksY">watch the first cast</a> and decide for
      yourself.
