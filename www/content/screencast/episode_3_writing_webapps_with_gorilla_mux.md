_Episode 3_

We show how to write more advanced web applications with the [`gorilla/mux`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux). We walk through example code that implements
a complex [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API and highlights
many of the features of the library.

This screencast expands on concepts in [episode 1](/screencast/episode_1_building_restful_api_using_only_std_lib), but you don't need to
watch that screencast to understand this one.
