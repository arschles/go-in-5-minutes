_Episode 15_

We finish the [concurrency series](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues/14) by showing how to solve the "Internet Cafe" problem on [Trivial Concurrency Exercises for the Confused Newbie Gopher](http://whipperstacker.com/2015/10/05/3-trivial-concurrency-exercises-for-the-confused-newbie-gopher/). The solution we'll show has a bug, however, and the extended screencast fixes it.

See [https://gum.co/gifm-x-15](https://gum.co/gifm-x-15) for more details.
