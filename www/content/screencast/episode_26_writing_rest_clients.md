_Episode 26_

Let's take a break from the [Buffalo series](/screencast/episode_25_buffalo_templating_with_plush/) and talk about a [highly requested topic](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues/109) - how to write clients for REST APIs.

<!--more-->

In this episode, we're going to use the [cobra library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to write a CLI for the [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev). But we won't take a standard DarkSky API client off the shelf this time! We're going to build one from scratch, using [gorequest](https://github.com/parnurzeal/gorequest), so we can see what goes into the process end to end.

Keep on rockin', Gophers!
