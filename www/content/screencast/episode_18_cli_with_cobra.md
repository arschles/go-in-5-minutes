_Episode 18_

This screencast teaches how to write a command line app in Go. We'll use the
[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) package, which is my go-to for every command line
app I've written for the last year.

I'm picking up Go in 5 Minutes after over a year! I wrote about it 
[here](/blog/hiatus/). *I want to say thank you to everyone
who has come back!*

Cheers, everyone :)
