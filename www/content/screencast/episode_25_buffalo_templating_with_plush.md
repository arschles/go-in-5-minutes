To write frontend code, you need to learn its templating language, called plush (https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush). Plush offers a more intuitive syntax and access to more powerful functionality than the standard library's [`html/template`](https://godoc.org/html/template) package, and it gets out of your way more so you can focus on your webapp, not learning another language or syntax.

Plush is really important to learn about, because you'll need it for any web application you build.
