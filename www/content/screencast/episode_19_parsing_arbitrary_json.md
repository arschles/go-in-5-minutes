_Episode 19_

There was a request in [#125](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues/125) that I do a screencast on how to consume json with unknown fields.

This screencast shows how to exactly that! I'll show how to parse JSON using just the standard library, and also point folks to a package that will help if you don't want to steal my code (which is totally fine by the way!)
