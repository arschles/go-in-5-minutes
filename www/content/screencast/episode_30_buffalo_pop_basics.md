_Episode 30_

Another episode in the [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) series! We're going to talk about how to use the [pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop) library alongside Buffalo to quickly and seamlessly integrate a database into your web application.

<!--more-->

I'll briefly introduce the library and how to use it, then we'll go right to the code and see it in action! This screencast is a whirlwind tour of everything database related in Buffalo. We're going to follow up in future screencasts to dive into many of the larger topics we visited in this one.
