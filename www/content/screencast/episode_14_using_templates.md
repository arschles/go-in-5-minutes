_Episode 14_

We show how to do use the the [`html/template`](https://godoc.org/html/template) package (and its close sibling, [`text/template`](https://godoc.org/text/template)). We pay special attention to templating tasks most common to web development like layouts, blocks and partials.

# Extended screencast

I've created a 1hr extended screencast to complement this one. This screencast elaborates on this package and how to use it in the real world. For a fee, you'll learn:

- Details on how the `html/template` package works
- More advanced features of the package
- Best practices for building larger template structures, suitable for a large web app

Go In 5 Minutes screencasts will always be free, while extended screencasts will be paid. I recommend you get this extended screencast if you're planning to build a larger application or want to learn more details on how to practically use it.
