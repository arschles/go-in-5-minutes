_Episode 20_

Tests are a _huge_ part of your codebase and your workflow includes writing lots
of tests (I hope!) We'll talk about how to up your testing game using 
[`github.com/stretchr/testify/suite`](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).

Why should you use more than just the standard [`testing`](https://godoc.org/testing)
package? Under what circumstances? What are the benefits? All covered here!
