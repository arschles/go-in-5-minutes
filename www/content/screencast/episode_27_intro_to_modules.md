_Episode 27_

Go Modules is a brand new system, but it's _the way_ we are going to do dependency management in Go, so we all need to be familiar with it!

<!--more-->

Go Modules was introduced in Go version 1.11, and it's going to be the default way to pull in and publish dependencies in Go. While you can still use other dependency management tools, modules are the future, so let's get onboard and learn all about them!

This episode gives you a taste of how they work and how to use them (hint: it's simpler than you think!). After you watch this one, you'll be able to go get started converting your codebase over to modules, or just experimenting with it if you like. Either way, I hope you enjoy!
