_Episode 23_

In this episode I'm coming at you from GopherCon Iceland to talk about
commonly used packages for Go!

<!--more-->

A GIFM viewer asked in [issue 148](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues/148) about common packages and frameworks outside the standard library that are useful for Go apps.

I go beyond the standard 5 minute format and talk for 20+ minutes about
great packages that you should look at for use in your Go apps.

If you're starting to write a new Go app, these packages can save you tons
of time. If you have an existing app, you can remove a lot of your code
and replace with some of these things.

After all, the best code you can write is no code!
