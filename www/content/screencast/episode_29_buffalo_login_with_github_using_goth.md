_Episode 29_

We're continuing the [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io) series! Lots of web apps have a login button, and yours probably will too. This time, we're going to learn how to build one so that your users can login with GitHub.

<!--more-->

We'll be using [the Goth library](https://github.com/markbates/goth) and the - [`buffalo-goth` code generator](https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo-goth) together to allow us to implement GitHub login in our app without writing much code ourselves. Code generation does a _ton_ of the work for us (and that's one of the many magical parts of Buffalo).
